//! Defines the trait implemented by all materials and exports various
//! supported material types. Materials are used to define how BxDFs are
//! composed to create the desired appearance
//!
//! # Scene Usage Example
//! The material will be specified within the materials list of the scene object. A type
//! and name for the material along with any additional parameters is required to specify one.
//! The name is used when specifying which material should be used by an object in the scene.
//!
//! ```json

//!         "type": "The_Material_Type",
//!          ...
//!     }
