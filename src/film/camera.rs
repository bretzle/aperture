//! Provides a camera based on a single transformation that positions
//! it in the scene
//!
//! # Scene Usage Example
//! The camera must specify information about its position in the world, the image dimensions
//! and the number of samples to take per pixel.
//!
//! ```json
//! "camera": {
//!     "width": 800,
//!     "height": 600,
//!     "samples" 512,
//!     "fov": 50.0
//!     "transform": [
//!         {
//!             "type": "translate",
//!             "translation": [0, 12, -60]
//!         }
//!     ]
