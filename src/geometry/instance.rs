//! Defines an instance of some piece of geometry in the scene, instances
//! can re-use loaded geometry but apply different transformations and materials
//! to them
//!
//! # Scene Usage Example
//! An instance is an instantion of geometry in your scene. The instance needs to know
//! its type (emitter/receiver), its name along with the geometry to use, material to apply
//! and transformation to place the object in the scene. The instances are specified in the
//! objects list in the scene file.
//!
//! The transform for the object is specified in the order in which the transformations should
//! be applied. For information on emitters see the emitter documentation.
//!
//! ```json
//! "objects": [
//!     {
//!         "name": "back_wall",
//!         "type": "receiver",
//!         "material": "white_wall",
//!         "geometry": {
//!             "type": "plane"
//!         },
//!         "transform": [
//!             {
//!                 "type": "scaling",
//!                 "scaling": 15.0
//!             },
//!             {
//!                 "type": "translate",
//!                 "translation": [0.0, 1.0, 20]
//!             }
//!         ]
//!     },
//!     ...
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! # Object Group Example
//! You can also specify groups of objects to have the same transformation applied to all of them.
//! This is done with a 'group' type object followed by a list of objects in the group. For a full
//! example see `scenes/cornell_box.json`.
//!
//! ```json
//! "objects": [
//!     {
//!         "name": "my_group",
//!         "type": "group",
//!         "transform": [
//!             {
//!                 "type": "translate",
//!                 "translation": [0.0, 1.0, 20]
//!             }
//!         ],
//!         "objects": [
//!             ...
//!         ]
//!     },
//!     ...
//! ]
//! ```
